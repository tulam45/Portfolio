# Mimic-Lego House Graphic
In this project, I created an animation of importing different objects into the code (`Doing it in C/C++`) and craft a `KeyTime Animation, Lighting Effect, and OBJ Import` to mimic an animation of the LEGO build within some game animation. The project is done with the learning of `openGL`.
